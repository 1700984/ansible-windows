# Ansible and Windows
This repo contains some scripts and other stuff that can be useful when using
Ansible with Windows hosts.

Further scripts and utilities may be added in the future as required.

## Scripts
There are a few scripts in the `scripts` folder that can be used to do things
like upgrade PowerShell to a certain version. The README page of that folder
has more details on each script and how to run them.
